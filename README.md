# project-euler

This respository contains solutions to some of the problems posted on `https://projecteuler.net/archives`.

Solutions are written in best optimized way that I could think of, still if you think that some of the solutions can be improved, then kindly step forward and give the more optimized algorithm/code in the issue section.

You can also help this repository grow by adding solutions to new problems posted on `project-euler` website.

This repository can also be used as a toolkit for competitive programming, containing solutions to some standard mathematical problems.
